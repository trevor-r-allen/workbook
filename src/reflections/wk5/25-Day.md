## Week 5 Reflection
I struggled quite a lot with node and servers this week, I felt like the pace was too quick and I wasn't able to grasp initial concepts before moving on to more complex ones. During the hackathon at the end of the week I was able to learn a few of the new functionalities from teammates that I wasn't able to grasp earlier in the week. Some of these difficulties may also be attributed to having been doing remote learning this week and, on top of new and difficult concepts, also dealing with difficulty hearing the lecture audio.
