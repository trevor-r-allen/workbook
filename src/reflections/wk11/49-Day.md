## Course Reflection
For the final I am most concerned about building the many-to-many relationships in C#/mySQL since I didn't fully grasp the implementation and flow of data in the lectures. I definitley plan to continue coding over the weekend and hopfully have all or at least most of the backend completed with postman tests passing. Any roadblocks I run into over the weekend I will try my best to resolve on Monday and get started on the Frontend on Tuesday at the latest. 
Overall, I feel the course has been intense and stressful yet rewarding. I do personally feel as though the workload was just a bit too much. Between labs/journals/career homework/udemy videos, after mentally demanding lectures I felt like some tasks were met with less effort/energy than they deserved or would have gotten had more time been alloted for them. Though perhaps this only applies to myself and my own limitations. Either way, all in all I still gained an immense amount of knowledge from this course and would readily do so again even knowing its difficulty in advance.  I'm quite appreciative that I had the oppourtunity.
