## Week 6 Reflection
Working with a partner was a good experience, it gave me a chance to learn a bit from him and shore up my deficiences, as well as learn some of the challenges that may arise in the workplace when working with others. During both checkpoints this week I also ran into a few interesting roadblocks that, once resolved, deepened my understanding of those concepts.
