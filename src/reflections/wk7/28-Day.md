## Thoughts on Designing a Strong User Experience

### What is a 'user experience'? What should be considered when developing a user experience?
A user experience, or UX, is any interaction a person could have on your digital medium. UX should help users do what they want to do in the easiest, most enjoyable way possible.

### What are some benefits of taking the user experience into account?
Good UX will help users reach your goal on your digital medium.  Eliciting certain emotions using design and considering the UX perspective can reinforce your brand and have a positive influence on users.

### Why is the user experience important?
Poor or unconsidered UX can lead to messy or confusing design, or even a lack of trust or rapport with users. Ultimately, this will lead to less users reaching the end of the design flow, which potentially means less purchases/conversions and potentially less visits/usage in general.
