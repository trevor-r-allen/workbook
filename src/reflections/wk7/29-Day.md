## Reflection on the Partner Checkpoint

### Which principles from this week's reading did you implement?
We used the pair programming method for most of the time, save for half a day where we worked on separate tasks. We also tested early and often.

### What went well?
Pair programming was very beneficial in my opinion, I was able to improve and reinforce my node.js/server knowledge with my partner. We were also both able to have a fairly full understanding of the entirety of our app throughout the development process.

### What would you do differently?
While we tried working on separate tasks, progress seemed to slow down and working through roadblocks became more challenging. I would prefer to maintain the pair programming throughout the entire process next time around as I feel it makes coding smoother, quicker and helps reinforce mutual knowledge through peer confirmation and agreement.
