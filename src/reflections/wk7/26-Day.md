## Thoughts on Pair Programming

### What is pair programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming is when two developers share the same workstation and work together while coding. One is the driver who does the typing and the other is the navigator who thinks ahead and keeps an eye out for mistakes.

### What are some benefits of pair programming?
Some benefits include increased code quality, as well as knowledge spreading through the team. Also, juniors can learn from seniors, coordination of pairs is easier than of individulas, and pairs can stay focused despite interruptions.

### What are some drawbacks to pair programming?
Both individuals must be actively engaged or the benefits will be lost, cost increases due to two deelopers working on the same task instead of on individual tasks, coding out loud is expected but not always enforced, and personal or relationship issues may cause problems if not addressed.
