## Thoughts on Vue3 Component Based Architecture

### What is component based architecture?
An architecture that encapsulates an interface by separating it into individual features called components.  Unlike MVCS architecture whose encapsulation separates by layers of responsibility, through each of which multiple features will pass through.

### What are some benefits of component based architecture?
Components can make calls to the api independently and refresh without affecting the rest of the page.  Also, components can be reused across the application with each component still acting independently. 

### What are some drawbacks of component based architecture?
Overuse of components can lead to cluttered looking pages. It is also easy to fall into a pattern of using componenets for everything even when it might not be necessary or beneficial.
