## Thoughts on How to Use Props in Vue

### What are props?
Props are Vue's way of passing variables and data between components. This works similar to passing an argument into a function 

### What are props used for?
Props are used to pass variables and data from a parent component to a child component.  They use a one way data flow and are read only when they have been passed.

### Where can props be used or accessed?
Props can be used/accessed in the template of the child component they have been passed to.  They can do this after they have been listened to by listing them in the props section of the script.
