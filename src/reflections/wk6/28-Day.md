## Thoughts on Vue.js Lifecycle Hooks

### What are lifecycle hooks?
Lifecycle hooks are functions that allow you to target specific points in the flow of processes. They provide a glimpse of how and when things happen during the lifecycle.

### What are lifecycle hooks used for?
They are used to perform various actions that need to occour at certai stages of the lifecyle and build process.  For example when rendering the page for the first time, or immediately after initialization. 

### What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
Hooks that allow you to access the component right before or after the initial render of that component. They might often be used to manipulate the DOM before or after the render, or if integrating non-vue libraries.
