# Day 28

## Final App Progress Reflection 
Was able to get through the debugging needed for an issue from yesterday and finish up the backend, including the stretch goals folder of the postman tests. Thankfully was able to get started on the frontend finally. After spending 2 weeks learning C#, working with Vue.js again felt much slower and less smooth than on previous checkpoints when it was fresh in my head. I had to reference syntax constantly. Was able to finish a few requirements and ended the day with the homepage displaying data and a basic layout for the home and profile pages. Still feeling behind where I need/want to be. Overall I feel like I didn't get much done today, especially in regards to requirements. Ended up focusing on css too much and sunk a lot of time into the modal layout in particular. Started to feel stressed out towards the end of the day. Kept thinking "tomorrow it will be 'due tomorrow' ".
