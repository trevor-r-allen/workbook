# Day 29

## Final App Progress Reflection 
Really pushed hard today, even though it was the height of my stress. Genuinely thought I might not get done in time based on the current state of the app. I noticed the stress and worry affecting my focus and ability to think clearly. Just had to keep grabbing one task at a time, pass a prop here, compute an appstate variable there, and didn't have time to waste thinking about optimal implementation. For the most part I just went with whatever first came to mind. Luckily that only really cause one issue in particular that I was able to identify later with some assistance. Passed a prop through a component and into the modal, but in the component I was actually passing an appstate variable instead of the prop, causeing it to be missing one necessary property in the modal.  At the end of the day I had made significant progress and had completed most of the requirements.  I decided to get a preliminary grading to check my progress before the final day and ended up passing.  Was only missing one requirement which I decied I would do the next day despite already passing.
