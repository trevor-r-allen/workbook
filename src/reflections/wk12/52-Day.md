# Day 27
__03/02/2020__

## Final App Progress Reflection 
Progress slowed quite a bit today, it seemed each thing I tried to implement on the backend was met with the need for debugging. Often a simple oversight on my part that would take me far longer to identify and resolve than I would have liked. Ended the day feeling a bit behind where I wanted to be because of it. Almost done with the backend, but ending the day still stuck on one of the postman tests failing.
