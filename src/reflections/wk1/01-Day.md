## Thoughts on Git

### Why do we use Git?
  Through the use of Git, developers end up with multiple versions of a particular project at various stages of development. This enables us to easily revert back to previous version as needed.

### What are the benefits of using multiple branches?
  The ability to use multiple branches in Git is another prominent reason for its use. Branches enable multiple developers to be actively making changes to a project simultaneously, without constantly needing to resolve conflicts with every commit.

### What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
  Git is the version control system itself that tracks and manages the various versions, branches, and commits for a project. GitHub on the other hand is a remote repository that has various useful features, with the primary functionality being the remote storage and retreival of the git state.
