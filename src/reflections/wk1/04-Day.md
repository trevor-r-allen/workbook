## Thoughts on Wire-Framing

### What is the purpose of wire-framing?
It enables communication and collective understanding of a starting point, which can be built upon or modified based on user and stakeholder feedback. It creates a stronger foundation from which development can begin, reducing the chances that major changes will be needed later in the development process and potentially saving money.

### What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low, Medium, and High fidelity wire-frames are differentiated by their level of detail. Low fidelity ones are general, basic, and layout focused; they're good for the earliest stages of design and can be generated and/or changed fairly quickly. As we move up in fidelity and detail we also add more advanced software tools to the mix as well as new levels of focus. Having the three tiers allows the focus to be at the right depth given the step of the design process.

### Do I think that wire-frames are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or why not?
At my current stage, I find wire-frames tedious and would prefer to start coding right away, mainly because I feel that is where I would benefit most from the practice and time. However, that is not to say that I don't see the value in wire-frames or that I don't plan to use it. I think that by getting into the habit of doing them, it will payoff in the long run, growing less tedious with practice while simultaneously benefitting the quality and expediency of my code.
