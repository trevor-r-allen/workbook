## Thoughts on Design

### What tip do I find is most beneficial to improving my design?
I already prefer using box shadows instead of borders, though I think adding the single colored border in certain places would be an impactful trick that requires minimal effort. Also, reading about using reduced contrast for font color as opposed to varying shades of grey really stuck with me.

### What resources might I find useful to reference good design examples:
Various graphic design blogs  or sites would be a great way to stay up to date on current trends and get inspiration, such as Abduzeedo, Behance, or even Pinterest. Also, the websites or webapps of prominent companies such as Adobe or Google set an example.

### How does good design influence people visiting a website, and what could be conveyed to them through design alone? 
Design is incredibly important and shouldn't be underestimated, it can determine how easy it is for someone to find what they are looking for, know if they're in the right place, or even be guided somewhere specific and intended. The opposite is also true and a poor layout or cluttered page or app can easily divert a page viewer to quiickly seek elsewhere.
Much can be conveyed through design and at the simplest level, choices as fundamental as colors can set the tone before the viewer even begins scanning the page.
