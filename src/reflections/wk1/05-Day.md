## Week 1 Reflection
I simultaneously feel like I learned a lot this week, as well as feeling like I don't know as much as I should or feeling behind.  The latter is often triggered when getting stuck on a project or having to constantly re-lookup properties and possible values. I know I its probably too early to need to know the solution to each task off the top of my head but it can be frustrating nonetheless. I'm looking forward to gaining a bit more mastery over the basics though, as I progress and learn more complex concepts.
