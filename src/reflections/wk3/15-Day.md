## Week 3 Reflection
At first glance MVCS and encapsulation seemed pretty intimidating. After looking at it for a couple days though, the flow and process started to make sense. I still struggled to implement it myself however without frequently referenceing lecture material for a refresh and to ensure I was on the right track. Hopefully with more practice the syntax will stick in my memory and my confidence with MVCS will improve.
