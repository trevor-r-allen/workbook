## Thoughts on A Beginner's Guide to SSL: What it is & Why it makes your website more secure

### What is an SSL certificate?
A small data file that encrypts the link between a web browser and a server.  It provides security and helps data traffic remain private.

### What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
Extended Validation is used to display legitimacy and is most needed when collecting payments or collecting data.  Organization Validated is used if you want to provide median strength encryption and aren't handling payments.  Domain Validation is the quickest and cheaper option and offers low level encryption.  Wildcard extends your domain's validation to subdomains.  Unified Communications is a multi-domain certificate that allows multiple different domains to be on the same cert.  Single Domain is for one domain only and doesn't include it's subdomains.

### What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
They can give your domain credibility and trust from users.  They can also protect you and your users' data with encryption, and also protect you legally if you will be collecting data or payments.
