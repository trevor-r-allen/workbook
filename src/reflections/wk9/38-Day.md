## Thoughts on Scrum for Small Teams

### How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
A reduced number of full attendance meetings to minimize interruptions to coding time.  Also, a greater emphasis placed on implementing continuous communication between team members via a messaging app.

### Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time?
So that the team has a unified understanding of the priorities for the given sprint.  Multiple sprints also divide the available resources/people which can hinder progress on the project overall.

### What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
The unattainable triangle is the following three tenants: 
'Good service Cheap won't be Fast'
'Good service Fast won't be Cheap'
'Fast service Cheap won't be Good'
It benefits Scrum by helping the dev team set realistic expectations, as well as providing the client a chance to weigh in on what the priority should be.
