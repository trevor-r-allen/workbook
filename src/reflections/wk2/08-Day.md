## Thoughts on Chrome Developer Tools

### What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/When should each style be used?
You can write to the console from within the code via a console.log() command, this helps ensure that the code is working properly at a particular point. You can also use it directly from the dev tools for several purposes, like testing functions, viewing errors, and viewing JS data.

### Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab allows you to view the HTML and CSS of the page. This is useful for debugging HTML due to utilities like the inspect tool allowing you to pinpoint specific elements on the page, as well as being able to view and edit the HTML and CSS of the page directly in the dev tools and see the change occur immediately.

### Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug code?
An alternate way to debug code is to use the source tab and debugger. You can use the debugger command in the code as well as use breakpoints built into the dev tools to target specific lines and walk through them pausing at each breakpoint or debugger.
