## Thoughts on Building a Powerful Developer Portfolio

### 
A developer porfolio provides a demonstration of skillset and capability to potential employers.  It will be crucial to have a few professional projects for them to look over.

### 
It helps you stand out from a crowd of candidates in intervies who have a similar skillset/skill level.  It serves as a background of work accomplished as well as proof of knowledge.

### 
I would include the capstone we are working on, since it is being design with a more complete and polished look with the intention of serving as a portfolio piece. Also, either Bug Tracker or the final project we have yet to do, as I would want to demonstrate projects built with the full skillset I've learned rather than earlier projects that were less robust.
