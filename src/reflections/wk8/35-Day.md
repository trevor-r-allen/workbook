## Week 8 Reflection
As a group when deciding on our capstone project, we were able to adapt as a team. After taking some criticisms of our first proposal to heart we shifted to an entirely different project and pitched the idea again. In the end I think all of us believe we made the right decision, and I am personally glad we were able to be decicive and adjust our course of action in a timely manner.
