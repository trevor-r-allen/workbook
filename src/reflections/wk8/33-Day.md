## Thoughts on Unit Testing

### What is software development testing?
Software development testing is writing tests for your code to ensure specific aspects of it are working. The more code coverage you have covered by tests the better.

### What are the benefits of testing in software development?
The benefits of testing include reducing the amount of bugs introduced.  Also, this results in lees time returning to fix code later and more time moving on to focus on building new features.

### What are some potential drawbacks of testing in software development?
Writing tests for all of the code you write adds more time until completion for something that otherwise would've been done sooner.  Also, incorrectly written tests can allow a false sense of security potentially letting you push buggy code.
