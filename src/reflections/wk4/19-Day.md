## Thoughts on an REST

### What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer.  Basically, when the client sends a request to the server, it transfers back a representation of the data requested.

### What does Stateless mean?
Stateless means the server doesn't keep track of requests.  It doesn't remember who requested what or when, it just responds to the requests as they come.

### What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
Utilizing endpoints with identifiers for the desired resources.  The HTTP method that indicates the action to be taken on that resource is also necessary.
